Litestream 1.3RC2
	Commented out a compiler warning directive about FD_SETSIZE on
	non-FreeBSD systems.  If noone has looked into this by now, noone
	probably ever will. :-/

Litestream 1.3RC1
        Removed DBUG scaffolding which was causing problems with some Linux
	systems due to obsolescence of varargs.h header.

Litestream 1.2
	This is the 1.2RC1 released.

Litestream 1.2RC1
	This is the jrb6 release with updated CHANGELOG and Makefile.

jrb6
	This adds DBUG89 cpp macro calls (turned off by CFLAGS in Makefile right
	now) and fixes the Linux plug-pulling DoS bug.  This also updates the
	restream.c code.

stj5
	Tracked down a bug in which a streaming source (ie, Darkice) cannot connect.
	This patch to stream.c should  be considered beta at this time (we've tested
	it, it works for us).  What other stream source clients want to connect and
	possibly cannot? (hence the beta statement)  The code in question is
	stream.c and begins at the commented section called "omaha" (inside joke
	[0]).  That said, it appears that Gene's development was to reverse engineer
	the shout protocol in part with a Windows system (check archive.org with
	www.litestream.net for details).  As such, Gene accounts quite often for
	\r\n\r\n which is a windowsism.  As such, if the Litestream server did not
	see that \r\n\r\n, it would kick the stream source.  Darkice, after review
	of the code was sending \n\n (seeing as Darkice is being developed on Unix /
	Linux).  We accounted for that in our code since we believe that Darkice is
	also  doing the right thing.  Unfortunately most people have to reverse
	engineer the shout protocols.  As such, difference between the platforms
	rear their heads in situations like this.  Given the terse comments (or lack
	of therefore) in the original Litestream codebase, we added the omaha
	comment to aid in finding the section of code (there is similar code
	sprinkled thruout but with different  applications).  This is a very small
	fix, one line in fact.  It is a major fix though.  Please see BUGS for
	additional info.  

stj4
	Incorporated rb4 after several hours of testing.  Updated LICENSE file to
	reflect current license.  Removed license info from each file and put in
	pointers to LICENSE Removed announce.h since it's out of date and pointers
	in code were removed.  General cleaning of code, removing cruft (such as
	commented code).  Updated Contact info, did not remove old info.  Updated
	Readme

rb4
	Basic analysis of announcement logic.  Attempted removal of announcement via
	state transition directly to STR_STREAMING in {restream,stream}.c.  Not yet
	tested.

stj3
	Commented out lines pertaining to announce.h and g_announce.  These lines
	are responsible for streaming an mp3 advertising the server and specific
	version therein when a new client connects.  There were several reasons for
	removing this from the codebase.  First and foremost, the announcement
	states the Litestream server version.  Given that new releases (such as
	this) are in progress it defeats part of the purpose of the announcement.
	Second, the mp3 is a VBR, and certain clients (noteably mpg123) have trouble
	with VBR mp3's.  Finally, the code for the mp3 more than doubled the size of
	the resulting litestream binary with the mp3 stripped.  This would not be
	good for embedded apps.

	This update also contains a patch by Rick "Roundeye" Bradley for the program
	source.  Roundeye's patch allows the user to specify an individual mp3 at
	the commandline rather than a playlist (put an mp3 in place of the
	playlist).  This feature was added for the RDTJ project and those users that
	want to stream a jukebox on a file by file basis.  The one advantage of
	Litestream (and despite Icecast docs and developers claiming otherwise) is
	that it does not kick clients when there is no source.  Thus, you can have
	clients connect to a server with no source, but once a source connects all
	clients connected will receive that source.  Clients will still stay
	connected when a source drops.  

stj2
	Change the logic in restream.c, see below for an explanation.

stj1	
	Change the logic in stream.c.  Now, users must explicitly requests
	stats.html in order to see the server stats.  Otherwise, the mp3 stream is
	sent out.  This gets around the issue of making sure HTTP client headers
	were defined for each and every client.  Special thanks to Brian Abent for
	sending this patch my way a year ago and a kick in the ass to myself for not
	looking at it until after I figured out what Brian had already sent me (yes,
	I reinvented the wheel).

Footnotes:
----

[0] Omaha refers to the song on Waylon Jennings Honky Tonk Heros album.  It was
the album that happened to be in the cd player when testing of live streaming
took place with darkice and litestream.  It also represents that you're in BFE
in the code.
