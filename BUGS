Bugs, what Bugs?

jrb6 FIXED:  fixed Linux DoS as listed below (yanked ethernet DoS).

stj5 introduced:  What, if any need, is there to keep the literestream code in
check with the litestream code in repects to the omaha fix?  Presumably
literestream is going to connect to a server, thus it's source is an existing
shout-type stream.  

Determine the cause of the stream hanging if a client's network connection
dies.  It appears that a client whose connection dies (ie, yanked ethernet 
cable) can cause the litestream server to hang the stream for other clients connected.  

Implement some sort of authentication for streaming sources.

--- BEGIN HISTORICAL BUGS ---
* If there is a network error and the yp server forgets about the stream
  information, the source must be restarted. Because I don't fully
  implement yp.
* No multiple yp servers because icecast speaks a different yp which I don't
  want to implement.
