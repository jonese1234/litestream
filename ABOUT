This file describes the various components of the Litestream MP3 Streaming
System.

Litestream Server

	Litestream Server is the streaming server.  It connects to a
	streaming source on one end and replicates that stream to clients
	on the other end.

	source --> Litestream Server --> clients

Literestream Server

	Literestream Server is the mirroring server.  It connects to a
	streaming server on one end and replicates that stream to clients
	(possibly other mirroring servers> on the other end.

	Litestream Server --> Literestream Server --> clients

	The Literestream Server is the way to scale Litestream.  It allows
	you to use few network resources between broadcast centers while
	maintaining good quality to your listeners.  For example, I could
	set up broadcast centers in Australia, Europe, and the US, all
	connected with Literestream Servers.  Australian listeners would
	connect to their local server instead of connecting to the one in
	the US, preventing network saturation.

Litestream Streaming Source

	Litestream Streaming Source is a simple, non-reencoding streaming
	source which streams a playlist to the streaming server.  It's an
	easy way to source a stream unattended.

Example of a real system:

	               Litestream Streaming Source
				    |
				    |
				    V
	                    Litestream Server
	                      /     |
	                     /      |
			 clients    V
				  Literestream Server
				    |        \
				    |         \
				    V       clients
	                  Literestream Server
			            |
			            |
				    V
			         clients
